# Array Deep Count

## Instructions

Array.prototype.length will give you the number of top-level elements in an array.

Your task is to create a function deepCount that returns the number of ALL elements within an array, including any within inner-level arrays.

## Example

deepCount([1, 2, 3]);  
//>>>>> 3
deepCount(["x", "y", ["z"]]);  
//>>>>> 4
deepCount([1, 2, [3, 4, [5]]]);  
//>>>>> 7
